# Obstacles faced me and solutions
- __Centering the metric item in the RecyclerView and set it as the selected metric__
The solution was to set a padding vertically, but it has to be a dynamic padding that means, the padding must be the item height (Can't be static in xml).
So I found out that creating a class of LinearLayoutManager to control the recyclerview rendering, you can then access the item height in "measureChildWithMargins".

- __Sharing a screenshot of the BMI result with other applications while saving it in cache storage (internal), not the external storage (shared).__
The solution was to use [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/FileProvider) which is used to provide a Uri that's accessible by other applications
who have a permission to access this Uri. Sending the Uri provided by FileProvider using the [Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) and adding the [Grant read permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION) flag

# Project Notes
- Loading ads using AdLoader doesn't work on Android Studio Emulators but works fine on real devices (Tested)
- If there isn't an ad available to be displayed, the NativeAdView' visibility is gone (in gallery section)
- AdChoices appear only when the Ad unit id is a real id not the testing one.
